# rex
'rex' is yet another react starterkit.

The goal is not to create an unopinionated kit.

If you were looking for one, I recommend [this](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is just something that fits my needs when learning react, with tools I like to use.

## Uses
- react
- react-router
- sass with bourbon and neat

Suggestions: redux, axios

## Supports
- styling directly inside components (with sass)
- easy routing provided by a layout which shows header and a footer on subroutes
- server-side rendering with express (universal javascript)

... that's pretty much it.

## How?
### Build files with watch
npm run dev

### Build files without watch
npm run build

### Run local server (no hot reloading)
npm run caddy

### Run production server
npm run prod
